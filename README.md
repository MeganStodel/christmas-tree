# Coding a Christmas tree

As a festive challenge, taking inspiration from [this post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/christmas-trees/), here is my attempt to create a Christmas tree using code.

Code available: [Here](tree.R)

## Future improvements

* Possible additions:
    * Pot and trunk
    * Presents
* Randomly place the baubles rather than hardcoding the positions, but ensuring they stay within the tree outline.
* Different coloured baubles
